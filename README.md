# User-Profile-Service-Logon-Failure-Fix

I made this years ago to fix the logon failure that is caused from a registry corruption.

One of my desktops with Windows 7 installed on it was corrupting accounts constantly so I wrote a automatic fixer. The post for the manual fix is in the section below and if it fits your situation then the fixer should work. The program just automatically does the steps from the fix guide. 
   
# Windows error that this fixes
"The User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded." http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947215

# To use:
1. Download and run as administer. 
2. Enter the corrupted account username (Case sensitive).
3. If it does not return a error restart your computer and the account will work.
    
# Common errors: 
1. Did not run as administer.
2. The username could not be found so the fix did not know what to fix.
3. Registry read error, could be a endless possibility of errors but 95% of time it is because the program was not run as administer.
